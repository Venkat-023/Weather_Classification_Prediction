# Weather_Classification_Prediction
A machine learning project that classifies weather into four categories — Sunny, Cloudy, Partly Cloudy, and Rainy — based on weather-related features such as humidity, altitude, region type, and cloud conditions. The project explores multiple models  with thorough preprocessing (encoding, null handling, standardization) and hyperparameter tuning.
